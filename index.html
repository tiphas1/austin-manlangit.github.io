      <p>
        Collaboration is neverending in people's everyday lives. People experience collaboration at home when talking to mom about what to do for dinner. In school, people collaborate with our colleagues with group studying and working together on projects. At work, people collaborate with their teams, brainstorming ideas, bringing different perspectives, and providing solutions to solve problems. Collaboration in the workplace is beneficial for many reasons, the most important being that it brings people together to share knowledge that promotes innovation and creativity when it comes to solving a problem or starting and completing a new task. When teams and people from different departments or companies collaborate, they are all able to utilize on the strengths and skills of one another in which people are able to share knowledge with each other. With Modern Solution, we are here to address the consulting issue on how effective managers and leaders affect collaboration in the modern work environment along with providing recommendations for managers and leaders to implement with their team members.

                What employees value the most is “autonomy at work.” Autonomy is defined as, in the report, “feeling like you have a choice in how to achieve your day-to-day work.” Meaning that employees like/want to be in control of their own work which brings promotes creativity and innovation. One of the ways autonomy promotes collaboration in the modern work environment is that because employees are in control of assigned tasks and/or projects, they can reach out to other team members who are like-minded, have related goals and ideas, or those who just want to be a part of it because of the collaboration involved. In the Slack report, they call this a “circular relationship” with autonomy. Autonomy lets employees challenge themselves and create work that has meaning to them, while also being in line with the organization’s goals. With this, we can also tie in how autonomy affects job satisfaction. <a class="links" href="https://slackhq.com/good-collaboration-bad-collaboration-a-new-report-by-slack#autonomy"> Read more about it here. </a>

                As employees continue to value the ability to work from home or elsewhere remotely, collaboration becomes progressively more important. Employees need to be able to effectively and efficiently communicate with others on their team and co-workers. This employee collaboration effectively increases the happiness of a workforce but also symbolizes a workforce who is educated. A benefit of workplace collaboration is that it will soon develop a sense of community within an organization. This sense of community also gives employees perceived organizational support which encourages the employee to go beyond their assigned role, soak in organizational knowledge, and excel the company forward with more knowledgeable decisions. With the modern work environment becoming more remote, collaboration is accomplished with the digital workplace. The digital workplace is described as a set of workplace tools, platforms and environments that is distributed in a usable and productive way. The stakeholders of the digital workplace experience virtually no friction with collaboration and communication which allows them to perform their jobs with much more effectiveness.  <a class="links" href="https://www.elcom.com.au/resources/blog/the-importance-of-collaboration-in-todays-workplace"> Read more about it here. </a>

                Organizational commitment isn’t the only barrier to collaboration in the workplace. In the Dana-Farber case study, all scientists believed in the mission of conducting breakthrough cancer research and had high organizational commitment because Dana-Farber gave them the flexibility to pursue whatever research interested them. However, their need to stay at the top of their field, pursue a specialized topic, and incentives within the organization that rewarded individuals and their own labs for results, created a competitive mindset that deterred them from collaborating with other experts. The challenge within many organizations is to create an environment that promotes problem solving as a team while not letting individual efforts go unrewarded and unnoticed. Organizations need to let individuals with high self-motivation and initiative shine while also promoting collaboration. <a class="links" href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/getting-your-stars-to-collaborate"> Read more about it here. </a>

                The benefit of teamwork is to not only improve work efficiency, but also to save time and effort. One person cannot handle a task that requires multiple people that have unique skillsets and different mindsets and ideas, which is why people collaborate in groups. With people working as a group, everybody is able to build upon each other’s strengths which will complement one another to get the job done. For teams to achieve a common goal, a clear focus is needed. This clear focus is for teams and people to be aware of the organization’s goal rather than focusing on the views of the individual. Employees need to understand the goal and commit to striving for it by having a clear direction, collaboration, and roles for effective teamwork. If the whole group has a clear expectation of work, goals, and responsibilities, the results will become smoother. <a class="links" href="https://hbr.org/2016/06/wicked-problem-solvers"> Read more about it here. </a>

                Williams et al. found job autonomy to be the most consistent determinant of proactive behavior by positively correlating to team problem-solving, idea implementation, personal initiatives, and improvement suggestions, I found this article to help me better clarify the key influences of job autonomy in the workplace. The article also helped me to better identify what self-managing teams look like by listing their key features: they allocate tasks amongst themselves, take responsibility for the quality and tools of their work, decide on the timing of their methods, allow team members the control and opportunity to manage their demands, and develop a shared sense of collective efficacy that they can shape their environment. <a class="links" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/096317910X502494"> Read more about it here. </a>

                  Our team was responsible for creating a list of 10 interview questions as each individiual was repsonsible for 2 questions each. Questions one and two were created by Mr. Justin Miethe which are about the key behaviors employers look for when hiring an employee for a job that relies on autonomy and if autonomy is more important within the different levels of the organization's hierarchy.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Questions three and four were created by Mr. Andy Huynh whose questions were about the differences between a boss and a leader and why teams need someone in that leadership role for large tasks and projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                Mr. Kalani King's questions five and six focused on introducing and implementing genuine-self management in the modern work environment while also replacing traditional teams. His other question is about how managers can monitor job autonomy by making sure goals are met, employees like their assigned roles, and everyone contributes to team proactive performance.
              </p>

                <p>
                Questions seven through ten by Mr. Austin Manlangit had a large focus on the interviewee's personal experiences on autonomy in the workplace throughout their career. The questions were about if autonomy has improved work collaboration in the organizations they've been with, how autonomy has differed in their various workplaces, and if teams have been more or less succcessful because of autonomy along with the balance or extent an employee can have autonomy. Lastly, his last two questions were about the value of autonomy with different employees. Each employee has different values, so some may value autonomy more than the other. If an employee does not agree with management and the organization and its goals, but is given the freedom to do their work however they want to everyday, then it is up to the employee to decide what they value the most.

                  After conducting interviews on five individuals, our team found that most of the answers were overall very similar. Three key things that all the interviewees shared in their answers were that they are always looking for an employee that has an ability to effectively convey their thoughts and ideas, either directly or over the virtually, to attract the attention of others to open other team member's perspectives and opinions along with someone who is reliable. The interviewees prefer leaders because they learn more from them and feel less pressure to do the work, and leaders help them stay productive by inspiring and engaging with their team members. Lastly, the interviewees desire autonomy in the workplace where they can make their own decisions and not be micromanaged or told what and how to complete tasks. Autonomy results in efficiency results, reduced overhead costs, and innovation in the workplace.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The interviewees had differing viewpoints when it came to questions three and nine. With question three, each person has their own experiences working with bosses vs. leaders. Each type (a boss or leader) will give them a better understanding of others’ experiences. With question nine, some interviewers will stay despite supervision conflicts, yet other interviewers preferred to leave if they did not agree with an organization’s goals.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Based on our interview, many aspects of our consulting issue were confirmed. Autonomy is valued in the workplace since autonomous employees contain desired employee characteristics such as self-motivation and accountability. Autonomy positively relates to improved job efficiency. Autonomy greatly increases work collaboration, innovation, and creativity since employees have the space and platform to contribute their unique ideas in the workplace. Employees value autonomy so much since most people enjoy having the ability to make their own decisions and having their suggestions acknowledged by others. Autonomy positively relates to high job satisfaction and high organizational commitment since their higher-order needs (alluded from E. Deci and R. Ryan’s Self-determination theory) are fulfilled.

                  Modern Solution conducted a survey of 100 participants for our consulting issue that involved people to rate questions on five factors from a scale of 1 to 5. The five factors are; Organizational Commitment (little commitment vs. strong commitment), Transformational Leadership (no transformation vs. high transformation), Employee Autonomy (no autonomy vs. high autonomy), Proactive Performance (little proactivity vs. extreme proactivity), and Work Process Inefficiency (highly efficient vs. not efficient).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Each factor has a unique identifier which has been been determined by calculating the mean of all participant's answers. For organizational commitment, the mean is 2.7975, transformational leadership is 3.1925, employee autonomy is 3.1825, proactive performance is 2.9975, and work process inefficiency is 3.055. Overall, most participants are above the mean.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When it comes to the correlation between all these factors, transformational leadership positively impacts employee autonomy with a correlation coefficient of 0.68. This correlation means that leaders encourage proactive problem-solving, personal initiative, and idea implementation.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Employee autonomy positively influences organizational commitment with a correlation coefficient of 0.46. Since most people like to have a sense of control over their lives, whether real or imagined, they would desire to stay with companies that offer this sense of control and independence.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Transformational leadership negatively influences process inefficieny with a correlation coefficient of -0.19. Transformational leaders who encourage proactive problem-solving and personal initiative influence employees to work harder and quicker in the workplace.
                </p>

                <p>
                   Process inefficiency negatively impacts employee autonomy with a correlation coefficient of -0.26. This can be interpreted as supervisors and managers would not give much autonomy to employees who are working slowly and inefficiently.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Process inefficiency negatively influences proactive performance with a correlation coefficient of -0.13. This is interpreted as a person who is not working efficiently, achieving results, and completing tasks when or before deadlines would not be someone who is considered to be proactively performing in the workplace.

 <h3> RECOMMENDATIONS </h3>
  <p class="text-center">There are a variety of solutions and recommendations that can be implemented for our consulting issue. Modern Solution has four recommendations.</p>

  <div class="col-xl-3 col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-3 project wow animated animated4 fadeInLeft">
        <div class="project-hover">
          <h2>Let them speak</h2>
            
            <hr />
            <p>When interviewing potential employees, let the interviewees freely talk about their accomplishments related to the role they are applying for. Someone who has taken the initiative to start personal projects out of self-interest and passion are more likely to be committed to their role and the organization along with collaborating better with other passionate team members. </p>

      <div class="project-hover">
          <h2>Invest in your employees</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Provide a path for employees to succeed and grow. Employees who are invested in their work will want to know if they have a future with the organization. Give employees many opportunities to learn knew things and acquire new skillsets to assist them in personal and professional growth while also giving them proper guidance, feedback, and direction. This requires managers/leaders to take genuine interest in their employees to understand their strengths and weaknesses.  </p>

      <div class="project-hover">
          <h2>Promote bonding between team members</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Let team members voice their own opinions and share their ideas amongst one another. Promoting a collaborative environment where no idea is a bad idea will give team members the opportunity to gain and share knowledge with each other along with being more experimental and innovative. Managers will then hold daily meetings in person or virtually to listen to the shared ideas the team has developed and test and implement them. </p>

          <h2>Implement remote collaboration tools in case the need arises</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has made a large effect on the workplace causing people to work from home. There are many collaboration tools out there for organizations to implement so that teams are able to properly collaborate. Organizations can implement video conferencing software like Zoom, Skype, Discord, or Cisco WebEx to schedule team video conferences and company wide video conferences for informational check-ins and feedback. Organizations can also implement chat communication tools like Slack to create workspaces for team members and other departments to be in immediate contact with each other for easy communication. </p>
