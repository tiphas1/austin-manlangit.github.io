        Collaboration is neverending in people's everyday lives. People experience collaboration at home when talking to mom about what to do for dinner. In school, people collaborate with our colleagues with group studying and working together on projects. At work, people collaborate with their teams, brainstorming ideas, bringing different perspectives, and providing solutions to solve problems. Collaboration in the workplace is beneficial for many reasons, the most important being that it brings people together to share knowledge that promotes innovation and creativity when it comes to solving a problem or starting and completing a new task. When teams and people from different departments or companies collaborate, they are all able to utilize on the strengths and skills of one another in which people are able to share knowledge with each other. With Modern Solution, we have been approached with the question on what are some factors affect collaboration in the modern work environment? bitch

                What employees value the most is “autonomy at work.” Autonomy is defined as, in the report, “feeling like you have a choice in how to achieve your day-to-day work.” Meaning that employees like/want to be in control of their own work which brings promotes creativity and innovation. One of the ways autonomy promotes collaboration in the modern work environment is that because employees are in control of assigned tasks and/or projects, they can reach out to other team members who are like-minded, have related goals and ideas, or those who just want to be a part of it because of the collaboration involved. In the Slack report, they call this a “circular relationship” with autonomy. Autonomy lets employees challenge themselves and create work that has meaning to them, while also being in line with the organization’s goals. With this, we can also tie in how autonomy affects job satisfaction. <a class="links" href="https://slackhq.com/good-collaboration-bad-collaboration-a-new-report-by-slack#autonomy"> here </a>

                As employees continue to value the ability to work from home or elsewhere remotely, collaboration becomes progressively more important. Employees need to be able to effectively and efficiently communicate with others on their team and co-workers. This employee collaboration effectively increases the happiness of a workforce but also symbolizes a workforce who is educated. A benefit of workplace collaboration is that it will soon develop a sense of community within an organization. This sense of community also gives employees perceived organizational support which encourages the employee to go beyond their assigned role, soak in organizational knowledge, and excel the company forward with more knowledgeable decisions. With the modern work environment becoming more remote, collaboration is accomplished with the digital workplace. The digital workplace is described as a set of workplace tools, platforms and environments that is distributed in a usable and productive way. The stakeholders of the digital workplace experience virtually no friction with collaboration and communication which allows them to perform their jobs with much more effectiveness.  <a class="links" href="https://www.elcom.com.au/resources/blog/the-importance-of-collaboration-in-todays-workplace"> here </a>

                Organizational commitment isn’t the only barrier to collaboration in the workplace. In the Dana-Farber case study, all scientists believed in the mission of conducting breakthrough cancer research and had high organizational commitment because Dana-Farber gave them the flexibility to pursue whatever research interested them. However, their need to stay at the top of their field, pursue a specialized topic, and incentives within the organization that rewarded individuals and their own labs for results, created a competitive mindset that deterred them from collaborating with other experts. The challenge within many organizations is to create an environment that promotes problem solving as a team while not letting individual efforts go unrewarded and unnoticed. Organizations need to let individuals with high self-motivation and initiative shine while also promoting collaboration. <a class="links" href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/getting-your-stars-to-collaborate"> here </a>

                The benefit of teamwork is to not only improve work efficiency, but also to save time and effort. One person cannot handle a task that requires multiple people that have unique skillsets and different mindsets and ideas, which is why people collaborate in groups. With people working as a group, everybody is able to build upon each other’s strengths which will complement one another to get the job done. For teams to achieve a common goal, a clear focus is needed. This clear focus is for teams and people to be aware of the organization’s goal rather than focusing on the views of the individual. Employees need to understand the goal and commit to striving for it by having a clear direction, collaboration, and roles for effective teamwork. If the whole group has a clear expectation of work, goals, and responsibilities, the results will become smoother. <a class="links" href="https://hbr.org/2016/06/wicked-problem-solvers"> here </a>

                Williams et al. found job autonomy to be the most consistent determinant of proactive behavior by positively correlating to team problem-solving, idea implementation, personal initiatives, and improvement suggestions, I found this article to help me better clarify the key influences of job autonomy in the workplace. The article also helped me to better identify what self-managing teams look like by listing their key features: they allocate tasks amongst themselves, take responsibility for the quality and tools of their work, decide on the timing of their methods, allow team members the control and opportunity to manage their demands, and develop a shared sense of collective efficacy that they can shape their environment. <a class="links" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/096317910X502494"> here </a>
